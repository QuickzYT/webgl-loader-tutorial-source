<img width=500 src="https://github.com/QuickzYT/webgl-loader-tutorial-source/blob/main/.github/thumbnail.png">

An example of a custom WebGL template in Unity. Originally created in context of a video tutorial to showcase how to customize the default loading screen that can be seen while loading a WebGL game.

## Extra information

The original project was created for Unity `2019.4.8f1`. This is an updated version of the project that has been modified to work with Unity `2020.3.36f1`.

Regarding the differences between `2019.4.8f1` and `2020.3.36f1`, the JavaScript logic using which the game is loaded, has been changed. Also the code itself now is stored in the index.html file directly instead of being stored separately in UnityProgress.js. There are also a few other differences.

If you wish to know a detailed difference in the code between the previous version in this one, here's the commit responsible for the project upgrade: <a href="https://github.com/QuickzYT/webgl-loader-tutorial-source/commit/32630b7305dd886cd0c50c7fe43cadb4a9bd78c3#diff-d4437a418bec64159748972ad1b9532fda313569623b61f49dffe7fc8c1dadb6">link</a><br>
