An example of a custom WebGL template in Unity. Originally created in context of a video tutorial to showcase how to customize the default loading screen that can be seen while loading a WebGL game.

The original project was created for Unity `2019.4.8f1`. This is an updated version of the project that has been modified to work with Unity `2020.3.36f1`.
